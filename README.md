# Geosense

This project is a rebooted version of `geosense.net`. The old website domain has been reclaimed by another organization. `geosense.io` seemed right for a fresh reboot with all the trends going on for the `.io`. Feel free to [discuss](https://github.com/yoangau/geosense-client/discussions) any ideas or suggestion and open [issues](https://github.com/yoangau/geosense-client/issues) on any bug or problems you encounter. Don't be shy to contribute by opening [pull requests](https://github.com/yoangau/geosense-client/pulls) or reviewing the code as much as you want.
